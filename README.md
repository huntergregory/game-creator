This project allows you to create and play scrolling platform games. 
After creating an account on our servers, you can login at any time to pick up your progress creating and playing games. 
A game center provides the connection between the player and the authoring environment, and also provides an interface to browse, comment, and rate games. 

The author uses simple structs including instructions for the engine to initialize its own java classes representing the data. 
Create a game object, then drag and drop it onto the screen and modify its properties. You can set other things as well as such as collisions and key events.

The engine, besides parsing authoring data, handles updating the data shared with player during each game loop.

The player gets the engine's data and displays image views and certain user data. It also includes our utility, a Heads Up Display with plotting capabilities.
